My name is Nikolai Gorbachev, and I am currently finishing my Master’s in Digital Humanities at the University of Bologna. I have a strong technical background (BSc at MIPT), which I have always combined with an interest in human-centered and creative applications of tech.

I started programming in 2017, at the beginning of my Bachelor’s studies, when I built my first small B2C-style project -- a simple air-hockey mini-game written in Swift. Even then, I was fascinated by the idea of literally holding the result of my own code in my hands. Since then, I have mostly worked professionally as a backend software engineer in companies of different sizes, primarily in web development. I currently work at an Italian company, Editoriale Nazionale, where I develop backend systems for internal B2B applications, mainly using Django and FastAPI.

I discovered Kotlin Multiplatform only a few months ago and was immediately overwhelmed with inspiration by the possibility of building for multiple devices from a single codebase, with shared logic and UI. This triggered my motivation to return to my earlier hobby of creating user-facing mobile-first applications

Another hobby of mine is strolling through cities with my wife and discovering new and interesting places. However, when visiting a new city, it is often difficult to decide what to see: often one either explores new places at random, or lets some generic “top-10” lists guide the exploration. This led to the idea behind CityWalk -- a tool that generates a personalized walking route for a specific city, taking into account the time the user has before departure.

CityWalk is my attempt to explore this idea using Kotlin Multiplatform. I hope you find the project interesting and enjoy exploring it

Best wishes from Bologna,
Nik
